# bibk
Xml file format definition for a basic variant of DocBook dedicated to bilingual text documents

## Dual language management
Letâ€™s say we have a document in a source language _so_, translated into a target language _ta_. The bilingual book audience is mainly composed of the target language users. So, the bibk root element should be in _ta_ language, and the source text is added via the _foreignphrase_ tag. For example:
```xml
<book xml:lang="ta">
  <info>
	   <title>Translated title<foreignphrase xml:lang="so" role="source">Original title</foreignphrase></title>
  </info>
<book>
```
